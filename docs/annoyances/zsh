starting tmux loses 256 color support
    need to port the TERM setting from my bashrc

during command-editing, if i scroll to the left in the command, i have to wait a second to see the position of the cursor -- it's hidden when repositioning it.
    cause:
        echo ${ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[cursor]}
        standout
    fix:
        ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[cursor]="standout,bg=green"



history is shared a little too much between sessions (see eevee's zshrc)

history completion makes me press enter twice
