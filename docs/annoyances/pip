Logging ascii error:
	pip install lxml (with no libxml headers) yields ascii error

Can't re-install pip.
	pip uinstall pip
	hash -r
	pip install --upgrade pip
	stops with "already satisfied".

get-pip.py doesn't work if in a virtualenv with pip unisntalled.

easy-install (an many setup.py's) add the system lib path ahead of the virtualenv path in easy-install.pth.
