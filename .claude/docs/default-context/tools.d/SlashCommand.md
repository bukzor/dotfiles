# SlashCommand

## Description

Execute a slash command within the main conversation.

## Full Instructions

How slash commands work:
When you use this tool or when a user types a slash command, you will see a message indicating the command is running, followed by the expanded prompt. For example, if .claude/commands/foo.md contains "Print today's date", then /foo expands to that prompt in the next message.

Usage:
- `command` (required): The slash command to execute, including any arguments
- Example: `command: "/review-pr 123"`

IMPORTANT: Only use this tool for custom slash commands that appear in the Available Commands list. Do NOT use for:
- Built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)
- Commands not shown in the list
- Commands you think might exist but aren't listed

Notes:
- When a user requests multiple slash commands, execute each one sequentially
- Do not invoke a command that is already running
- Only custom slash commands with descriptions are listed in Available Commands
