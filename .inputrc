# configuration file for readline (aka "tab completion")
# this is done in /etc/inputrc, but they only enabled it for emacs mode:

# Use a flash instead of a ding.
set bell-style visible

# Make sure we don't output everything on the 1 line
set horizontal-scroll-mode Off

# Enable 8bit input
set meta-flag On
set input-meta On

# Turns off 8th bit stripping
set convert-meta Off

# Keep the 8th bit for display
set output-meta On

# tab completion!
tab: complete

# All of the following map the escape sequence of the
# value contained inside the 1st argument to the
# readline specific functions
